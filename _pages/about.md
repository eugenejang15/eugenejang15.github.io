Prior to joining USC Annenberg, she graduated from Seoul National University (SNU), receiving her B.A. and M.A. in communication. She formerly served as a research assistant at the SNU Big Data Institute and also worked for the SNU Human Ecology Research Institute, focusing on surveillance, data brokers, and privacy.
